For this activity, you will learn about the power of collaboration on GitHub. You will also learn some of the pain associated with this, but that's part of learning too.

You and your partner will work on a simple menu system. One of you will take the role of the UI designer, the other will take on the role of the UX designer. Here is how that breaks down.

UI Designer
You will be responsible for the "look and feel" of the menu. In other words, you will choose the colours, background, font, and any other visual elements in the menu. You will decide where buttons are placed (the layout) on each level of the menu.

UX Designer
You will be responsible for the logical flow of the menu system and coding any button functions that might be required. All the buttons should do something or go to another level of the menu (see below).

Menu Levels

Level 1
Should include a title, a Hello button (that prints "hello" in the shell), a Settings button (that leads to level 2), and a Quit button (that closes the program).

Level 2
Should include a title ("Settings"), a subtitle ("Sound"), an ON button (prints "sounds on" in the shell), an OFF button (prints "sounds off" in the shell), and a Back button (that returns to level 1).

NOTE: This is a learning activity, and not for grade.
